# Question 5

```ruby
[[1, 2], [3, 4]].map do |arr|
  arr.map do |num|
    num * 2
  end
end
```

* `Array#map` is called on the multi-dimensional array `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
* Each inner array is passed to the block in turn and assigned to local variable `arr`
* `Array#map` is called once again, but this time on `arr`
* Each integer in the inner array `arr` is passed to the block in turn and assigned to local variable `num`
* `num * 2` is evaluated, and since this is the last evaluated statement of the block, the return value is also `num * 2`
* `Array#map` creates a new array with the return values of the block, so the inner method call returns `[2, 4]`, then `[6, 8]`.
* Since the return value of the inner `Array#map` is the last evaluated statement of the outer block, the block returns `[2, 4]`, then `[6, 8]`
* The `Array#map` creates a new array with the return values of the block, so the outer method call returns `[[2, 4], [6, 8]]`.
