# Question 1

```ruby
[[1, 2], [3, 4]].each do |arr|
  puts arr.first
end
# 1
# 3
# => [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```

* `Array#each` method is being called on the multi-dimensional array `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
* Each inner array is passed to the block in turn and assigned to local variable `arr`
* The `Array#first` method is being called on `arr` and returns the object at index `0`, which is `1` and `3`, respectively.
* The `puts` method then outputs the string representation of the integer
* The `puts` method returns `nil`, and since this is the last evaluated statement of the block, the return value of the block is also `nil`
* The `Array#each` method doesn't use the return value of the block though, and returns the original array, `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
