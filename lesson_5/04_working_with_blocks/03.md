# Question 3

```ruby
[[1, 2], [3, 4]].map do |arr|
  puts arr.first
  arr.first
end
```

* The `Array#map` method is being called on the multi-dimensional array `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
* Each inner array is passed to the block in turn and assigned to local variable `arr`
* Inside the block, the `Array#first` method is being called on `arr` and returns the object at index `0`, which is `1` and `3` in our case, respectively
* The string representation of the integers are outputted to the screen with `puts`
* `Array#first` is called again on the second line, and returns `1` and `3` once again
* Since this is the last evaluated statement of the block, `1` and `3` are the return values of each block iteration
* Since `Array#map` creates a new array with the return values of the block, `[1, 3]` is returned
