# Question 6

```ruby
[{ a: 'ant', b: 'elephant' }, { c: 'cat' }].select do |hash|
  hash.all? do |key, value|
    value[0] == key.to_s
  end
end
# => [{ :c => "cat" }]
```

* `Array#select` is called on `[{ a: 'ant', b: 'elephant' }, { c: 'cat' }]`, an array with nested hashes
* Each hash is passed on to the block in turn and assigned to local variable `hash`
* `Enumerable#all?` method is called onto `hash` and the key and value of the hash are assigned to `key` and `value`, respectively
* Inside the block, `value[0] == key.to_s` is evaluated, where `String#[]` is called on `value` with argument `0`, which returns the character at index `0`, and `Symbol#to_s` is called on `key`, which returns the string representation of the symbol
* This evaluates to `true` for `a: 'ant'`, `false` for `b: 'elephant'`, and `true` for `c: 'cat'`
* Since `value[0] == key.to_s` is the last evaluated statement of the block, the return value of the block is also `value[0] == key.to_s`
* The `Enumerable#all?` method returns `true` if all of the return values of the block returns `true`, and returns `false` otherwise
* This means the first `hash` returns `false`, and the next returns `true`
* Since the `Enumerable#all?` method is the last evaluated statement of the block, the return value of the `Enumerable#all?` method is also the return value of the outer block
* `Array#select` creates a new array with all elements for which the given block returns truthy; therefore, the return value of the method is `[{ c: 'cat' }]`
