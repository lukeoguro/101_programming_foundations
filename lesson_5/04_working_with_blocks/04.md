# Question 4

```ruby
my_arr = [[18, 7], [3, 12]].each do |arr|
  arr.each do |num|
    if num > 5
      puts num
    end
  end
end
```

* The `Array#each` method is called on the multi-dimensional array `[[18, 7], [3, 12]]`
* Each inner array is passed to the block in turn and assigned to local variable `arr`
* The `Array#each` method is called again, this time on inner array `arr`
* Each integer in the inner array `arr` is passed to the block in turn and assigned to local variable `num`
* In the inner `Array#each` method, there is an `if` expression that is evaluated if `num` is greater than `5`
* In case the expression returns `true`, the `puts` method is called on `num`, which outputs the string representation of the integer onto the screen
* In our case, `18`, `7`, and `12` will be outputted to the screen
* The `puts` method returns `nil`, and since this is the last evaluated statement of the `if` expression, the `if` expression will return `nil` if evaluated
* Since an unevaluated `if` also returns `nil`, and the `if` condition is the last evaluated statement of the inner `Array#each` loop, the return value of the block is always `nil`
* Regardless, this is not pertinent as the `Array#each` method does not use the return value of the block, and instead returns the original array, which is `[18, 7]` and `[3, 12]`
* Since the inner `Array#each` method is the last evaluated statement for the block of the outer `Array#each` method, `[18, 7]` and `[3, 12]` are the return values
* Once again, this is not pertinent as the `Array#each` method does not use the return values of the block, and the original array `[[18, 7], [3, 12]]` is returned
* The return value of the outer `Array#each` method is assigned to variable `my_arr`, so `my_var` is assigned to `[[18, 7], [3, 12]]`
