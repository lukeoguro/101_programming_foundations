# Question 7

```ruby
a = 2
b = [5, 8]
arr = [a, b]      # arr = [2, [5, 8]]

arr[0] += 2       # arr = [4, [5, 8]]; a = 2
arr[1][0] -= a    # arr = [4, [3, 8]]; b = [3, 8]
```

On line `arr[0] += 2`, the `Array#[]=` method is called to assign element at index `0`, which in our case is `2`, to `4`.
Since the element is being reassigned, `arr[0]` now points to another object, and integer `2` that variable `a` is still pointing to is not mutated.
Therefore, `a` remains equal to `2`, and the `arr` is now `[4, [5, 8]]`.

On line `arr[1][0] -= a`, the `Array#[]` method is chained with the `Array#[]=` method.
The first method call is referencing the element at index `1` of `arr`.
This is array `[5, 8]`, which is also pointed to by `b`.
The second method call is reassigning the element at index `0` of `[5, 8]`, which is `5`, to `3`.
Since the object is mutated, not reassigned, both `b` and `arr[1]` still point to the same object, which is now `[3, 8]`.
Therefore, `arr` is equal to `[4, [3, 8]]` and `b` is equal to `[3, 8]`.
