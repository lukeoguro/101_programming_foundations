# Question 2

```ruby
greetings = { a: 'hi' }
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
informal_greeting << ' there'

puts informal_greeting  #  => "hi there"
puts greetings          #  => "{ a: 'hi there' }"
```

`informal_greeting` is pointing to the value assigned to key `:a` in the `greetings` hash.
Since `informal_greeting << ' there'` is mutating, the value assigned to key `:a` is now `'hi there'`.

Instead of `#<<`, if we used `#+=`, `greetings` would have remained as `{ a: 'hi' }`.
This is because `informal_greeting` is now pointing to a new variable, and `greetings[:a]` remains untouched.
