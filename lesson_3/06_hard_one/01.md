# Question 1

```ruby
if false
  greeting = "hello world"
end

p greeting
```

The code above outputs `nil`, instead of the usual "undefined method or local variable" exception.
The reason is that even if code is not evaluated, the variable is initialized to `nil`.

I've actually seen this before in [Ruby Docs](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/faq/4/),
when I was exploring a different case of method names and variable names being the same.
I found that ruby will assume for a variable if it has seen an assignment operator; otherwise,
it will assume you're calling for a method.

```ruby
def a
  puts "method `a' called"

  99
end

[1, 2].each do |i|
  if i == 2
    puts "a = #{a}"
  else
    a = 1
    puts "a = #{a}"
  end
end
```

In the example code above, the first `puts` statement will assume `a` is a variable, and the second
puts statement will assume `a` is a method.
What's interesting is, even if `a = 1` was actually `a = 1 if false`, the first `puts` statement
will still assume `a` is a variable because `a` was initialized with an assignment operator,
even if the code wasn't evaluated.
