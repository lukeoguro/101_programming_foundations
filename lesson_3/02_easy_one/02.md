# Question 2

1. `!=` is the not-equals-to operator.
It returns `true` if the two objects are not equal
2. `!` turns the object into its boolean opposite.
3. The `!` suffix implies that the method mutates the caller.
4. Putting `?` before an object most likely indicates a ternary operator.
5. The `?` suffix is Ruby convention for indicating the method returns a boolean.
6. `!!` turns the object into its boolean equivalent.
