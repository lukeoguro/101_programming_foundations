# Question 4

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.delete_at(1)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.delete(1)
```

The `#delete_at` method removes the object at the given index.
In our case, the index is `1` and the object is `2`.

The `#delete` method removes the object passed.
Thus, numbers will become `[2, 3, 4, 5]`.
