# Question 1

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]
numbers.uniq

puts numbers
```

The code above prints:

```shell
1
2
2
3
```

4 terms are printed instead of 3, because the `#uniq` method does not mutate the initial `numbers` array.
Also, since the `#puts` method is called with an array argument, each element is written on a new line.
Calling `#uniq!` would have printed:

```shell
1
2
3
```
