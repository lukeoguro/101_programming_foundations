# Question 4

```ruby
def rolling_buffer1(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer << new_element
  buffer.shift if buffer.size > max_buffer_size
  buffer
end

def rolling_buffer2(input_array, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer = input_array + [new_element]
  buffer.shift if buffer.size > max_buffer_size
  buffer
end
```

There is a difference between the two methods.
While they both return the same value, the `rolling_buffer1` method mutates the input argument called `buffer`.
`rolling_buffer2` does not.
