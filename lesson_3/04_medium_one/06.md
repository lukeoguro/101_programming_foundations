# Question 6

```ruby
answer = 42

def mess_with_it(some_number)
  some_number += 8
end

new_answer = mess_with_it(answer)

p answer - 8
```

The output of the code above is `34`.

In the first line, the `answer` variable is assigned to integer `42`.
Later, the `answer` variable is passed as the argument for the `some_number` parameter in the `mess_with_it` method; however, local variable `some_number` is never mutated, only reassigned.
Therefore, variable `answer` is still assigned to integer `42`.
The output is `42 - 8`, which is `34`.
