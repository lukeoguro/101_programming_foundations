# Question 2

```ruby
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)
```

The code above produces an error because the `#+` method can only concatenate two strings (i.e., `(40 + 2)` returns an integer).
This can be fixed with the following code:

```ruby
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{(40 + 2)}"
```
