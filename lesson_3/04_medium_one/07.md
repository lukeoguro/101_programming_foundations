# Question 7

```ruby
munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

def mess_with_demographics(demo_hash)
  demo_hash.values.each do |family_member|
    family_member["age"] += 42
    family_member["gender"] = "other"
  end
end

mess_with_demographics(munsters)
```

In the code above, the `mess_with_demographics` method is being called with the hash `munsters` as the argument for the `demo_hash` parameter.
Since both `family_member["age"] += 42` and `family_member["gender"] = "other"` use the indexed assignment method `#[]=` and since `#[]=` is mutating, altering `demo_hash` alters `munsters` too.
