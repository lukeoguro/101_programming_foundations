# Question 3

```ruby
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

The code above will output:

```shell
My string looks like this now: pumpkins
My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]
```

This is simply because the `#+=` method creates a new variable, while `#<<` mutates.

When a method is called, Ruby passes a reference to an object, which is assigned to a parameter a new local variable.
These variables (i.e., parameters) only live in the scope of the method definition.
And yet, the output is different because while `#+=` reassigns `a_string_param` to a new variable, `#<<` mutates, which ultimately affects `my_array` because `an_array_param` and `my_array` both point to the same variable.
