=begin
Write a method that takes a string as an argument, and returns an Array that contains
every word from the string, to which you have appended a space and the word length.
You may assume that words in the string are separated by exactly one space, and that any
substring of non-space characters is a word.

PROBLEM
input: string
output: an Array of strings
explicit:
  write a method
  return an Array that contains every word from the string, to which you have appended a space and the word length
implicit:
  words are separated by exactly one space
  any substring of non-space characters is a word

TEST CASES
word_lengths("cow sheep chicken") == ["cow 3", "sheep 5", "chicken 7"]
word_lengths("baseball hot dogs and apple pie") ==
  ["baseball 8", "hot 3", "dogs 4", "and 3", "apple 5", "pie 3"]
word_lengths("It ain't easy, is it?") == ["It 2", "ain't 5", "easy, 5", "is 2", "it? 3"]
word_lengths("Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious") ==
  ["Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 34"]
word_lengths("") == []
