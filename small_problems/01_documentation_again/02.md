# Question 2

```ruby
require 'date'

puts Date.civil
puts Date.civil(2016)
puts Date.civil(2016, 5)
puts Date.civil(2016, 5, 13)
```

The `puts` statements prints:

```ruby
-4712-01-01
2016-01-01
2016-05-01
2016-05-13
```

The reason for this is that the `Date::civil` class method doesn't require any arguments.
If no argument is given, the default values are passed in, which are `-4712`, `01`, and `01` for `year`, `month`, and `mday`, respectively.
