# Question 10

```ruby
array1 = %w(Moe Larry Curly Shemp Harpo Chico Groucho Zeppo)
array2 = []
array1.each { |value| array2 << value }
array1.each { |value| value.upcase! if value.start_with?('C', 'S') }
puts array2
```

`array2` is equal to `["Moe", "Larry", "CURLY", "SHEMP", "Harpo", "CHICO", "Groucho", "Zeppo"]`.

* In the first line, `array1` is assigned to `["Moe", "Larry", "Curly", "Shemp", "Harpo", "Chico", "Groucho", "Zeppo"]`.
* In the second line, `array2` is assigned to an empty array.
* In the third line, the `Array#each` method is called on `array1`, and each string in `array1` is passed to the block in turn and assigned to local variable `value`.
* `value` is appended to `array2`, so now `array2` is a separate array from `array1`, but each element is pointing to the same object
* In the fourth line, the `Array#each` method is called again on `array1`, and each element is passed to the block in turn and assigned to `value` once again
* A mutating method is called on `value` if the condition is met; therefore, the elements in `array1` are also mutated
* Since the elements in `array1` and `array2` are pointing to the same objects, elements in `array2` are also mutated accordingly
