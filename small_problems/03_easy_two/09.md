# Question 9

```ruby
name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name.upcase!
puts name, save_name
```

The code above prints `'BOB'` twice.

* In the first line, variable `name` is assigned to string `'Bob'`.
* In the second line, we assign variable `save_name` to point to the same object as variable `name`, which is `'Bob'`.
* In the third line, we mutate the object variable `name` is pointing to, such that `'Bob'` is now `'BOB'`.
* Since both `name` and `save_name` are still pointing to the same object, the last line prints `'BOB'` twice.
