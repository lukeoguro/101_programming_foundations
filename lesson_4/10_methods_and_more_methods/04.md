# Question 4

```ruby
['ant', 'bear', 'cat'].each_with_object({}) do |value, hash|
  hash[value[0]] = value
end
```

The code returns `{"a"=>"ant", "b"=>"bear", "c"=>"cat"}`.

The `#each_with_object` method does the following according to [Ruby docs](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-each_with_object):

> Iterates the given block for each element with an arbitrary object given, and returns the initially given object.

In our case, the `#each_with_object` method is called with an empty hash `{}` as the argument.
The argument is then passed into the block, where each iteration adds a key-value pair, in which the key is the first letter of the element and the value is the element itself.

Finally, the updated object is returned after three iterations.
