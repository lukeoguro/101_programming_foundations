# Question 1

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].select do |num|
  num > 5
  'hi'
end
```

The return value of the code above is `[1, 2, 3]`, because the return value of the block is always truthy (e.g., `'hi'` is always returned, and always truthy).
Therefore, the `#select` method will return a new array with all the original elements.
