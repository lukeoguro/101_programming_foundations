# Question 5

```ruby
hash = { a: 'ant', b: 'bear' }
hash.shift
```

The method `#shift` does the following according to [Ruby docs](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.7.0/Hash.html#method-i-shift):

> Removes a key-value pair from hsh and returns it as the two-item array [ key, value ], or the hash's default value if the hash is empty.

Thus, the return value of `hash.shift` is `[:a, "ant"]`, and `hash` is now `{:b=>"bear"}`.
