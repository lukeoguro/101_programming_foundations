# Question 7

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].any? do |num|
  puts num
  num.odd?
end
```

The block's return value is `true` or `false`, depending on the last evaluated statement, `num.odd?`.

The `#any?` method returns `true` if the block ever returns truthy.
Since the block returns `true` in its first iteration, `#any?` also returns `true`.

It's also noteworthy that only `1` is printed and not the remaining elements, because the method no longer iterates past the first time.
