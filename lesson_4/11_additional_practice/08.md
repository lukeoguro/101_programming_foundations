# Question 8

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.shift(1)
end
```

In the first iteration, the block will print `1`.
Then the `#shift` method will remove the first element of the array, giving us `[2, 3, 4]`.

In the second iteration, the block will print the second element of the array, which is now `3`.
The `#shift` method will again remove the first element of the array, leaving us with `[3 , 4]`.

The third iteration will not commence, because there is no longer a third element.

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.each do |number|
  p number
  numbers.pop(1)
end
```

In the first iteration, the block will print `1`.
The `#pop` method will remove the last element of the array, giving us `[1, 2, 3]`.

In the second iteration, the block will print `2`.
The `#pop` method will once again remove the last element of the array, giving us `[1, 2]`.

The third iteration will not commence.
